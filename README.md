# Harriet Boone Artisan Works Website

## Overview

The Harriet Boone Artisan Works website is designed as a portfolio with e-commerce integration. It showcases handcrafted wooden wearables and facilitates online sales through a responsive, interactive design that adheres to WCAG 2.1 standards. This project demonstrates proficiency in web programming languages and incorporates modern design elements with a traditional touch. Detailed documentation is provided to guide setup, navigation, and future maintenance.

## Local Setup and Running the Site

2. Navigate to the Project Directory: cd "F:\2025UniSA\SP-1-25\INFT_1062\Assessments\Assessment-2.1\assessment-2.1"  
3. Open the Website: Open any of the HTML files (e.g., index.html) directly in your web browser. For full functionality (including dynamic content loading), run a local server. For example, using Python: python -m http.server Then, navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Navigating the Website

The website consists of five main pages:

Blog Posts: Update the HTML content in blog.html directly or maintain blog posts in a separate JSON file if desired. Ensure consistency in formatting for a uniform look.

## Maintenance and Extension Guidelines

Regular Updates: Keep third-party libraries, hosting configurations, and security certificates up to date.

Scalability: As website traffic grows, consider migrating to a more scalable hosting solution or applying performance optimization techniques.
